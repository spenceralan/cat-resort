# Build a Resort Webpage - Epicodus

For this project my team created a webpage for a fictional (and hopefully humorous) cat resort using HTML and CSS. The main goal of this project was to demonstrate multiple pages branching from a main index.html page along with synchronized styling.

## Getting Started

There are at least two ways of accessing the website. First and easiest is to follow the link https://spenceralan.github.io/cat-resort/ Second is to clone this repository onto your machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Prerequisites

Web Browser

Examples: Chrome, Safari

### Installing

Installation is quick and easy! Either open this link https://spenceralan.github.io/cat-resort/ to see the webpage in action or clone this repository to your machine and open the index.html file!
